_Pomme Plate_ is a collection of flat mockups you can use, remix, transform and share. You don't need to credit me in any way and you can use the work for commercial purpose.

_Pomme Plate_ means "Flat Apple" in French.

Old devices (such as iPhone 4 or iPad Mini 2) are not shown in the overviews, but are present in the releases.

## Download
Rather than clone the entire project (and its history) head over to [releases](https://github.com/ephread/PommePlate/releases/) to get the latest release.

## Overview
All mockups are available in SVG and PNG and Sketch project files.

I am not a designer. Although I find a certain harmony between the color I've chosen, your sharp, educated eye might tell you otherwise.

You can tweak the colors if necessary.

Older devices are not included in the overview, but are available in the release archive.

### iPhone ###

**Note:**
> iPhone X/XS (Max)/11 Pro (Max) appear bigger than they should be, since they have a higher density than other iPhones (458ppi). They should be 29% smaller to match the size of iPhone SE and iPhone XR/11 (326 ppi).
>
> This logic also applies to older iPhone 6/6s/7/8 Plus. They have a 2208×1242 viewport downsampled to 1920×1080. Keeping the original screen resolution let you add screenshots, but requires to reduce the size of the whole thing (mockup + screenshot) by about 13.1%. Then, to match the physical size of other iPhones, they need to be further reduce by about 19%.
> TL;DR: You need to reduce the size of any "Plus" iPhone by roughly 30%.

### iPad ###
