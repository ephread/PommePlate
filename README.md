_Pomme Plate_ is a collection of flat mockups you can use, remix, transform and share. You don't need to credit me in any way and you can use the work for commercial purpose.

_Pomme Plate_ means "Flat Apple" in French.

## Download
Rather than clone the entire project (and its history) head over to [releases](https://github.com/ephread/PommePlate/releases/) to get the latest release.

## Overview
All mockups are available in SVG and PNG and Sketch project files.

I am not a designer. Although I find a certain harmony between the color I've chosen, your sharp, educated eye might tell you otherwise.

You can tweak the colors if necessary.

Older devices are not included in the overview, but are available in the release archive.

### iPhone ###

**Note:**
> iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus appear much bigger than they should be. That's because they have a 2208×1242 viewport downsampled to 1920×1080. Keeping the original screen resolution allows you to add screenshots; you'll then need to reduce the size of the whole thing (mockup + screenshot) by about 13.1%.

### iPad ###

**Note:**
> Once again, device sizes are depending on their resolution rather than their physical size. The iPad Mini is about 15.3% smaller than the iPad Air. The screen size of an iPad 3 or an iPad 4 is the same as the screen size of an iPad Air. Non retina devices are 50% bigger.

### MacBook ###
